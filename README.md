# ep\_guest

![Screenshot](docs/img/screenshot.png)

Etherpad plugin that grants limited access to users that are not logged in via
another authentication plugin such as
[ep\_openid\_connect](https://www.npmjs.com/package/ep_openid_connect).

When a user first visits Etherpad, they will be "authenticated" as a guest user
with permissions configured by the administrator. A "log in" button in the user
drop-down list forces the user to authenticate via Etherpad's built-in HTTP
basic authentication or via an authentication plugin (if one is installed).
After logging in, the "log in" button becomes a "log out" button.

This is a fork of
[ep\_readonly\_guest](https://github.com/ether/ep_readonly_guest) that allows
admins to relax that plugin's read-only restriction.

## Configuration

#### Minimal Example

```json
  "requireAuthentication": true,
```

#### Full Example

The following is equivalent to the above minimal example:

```json
  "requireAuthentication": true,
  "ep_guest": {
    "username": "guest"
  },
  "users": {
    "guest": {
      "displayname": "Read-Only Guest",
      "displaynameChangeable": false,
      "readOnly": true
    }
  },
```

#### Details

  * `requireAuthentication`: Must be explicitly set to `true` to enable this
    plugin.
  * `ep_guest.username` (optional, defaults to `"guest"`): The username used for
    the guest account. The corresponding object in the `users` setting (see
    below) contains settings for the guest account.
  * `users[ep_guest.username]` (optional, default is described below): Object in
    `users` that holds settings for the guest account. Relevant properties:
      * `displayname` (optional): See the
        [ep\_user\_displayname](https://github.com/ether/ep_user_displayname#configuration)
        plugin.
      * `displaynameChangeable` (optional): See the
        [ep\_user\_displayname](https://github.com/ether/ep_user_displayname#configuration)
        plugin.
      * `readOnly` (optional): See [Etherpad's `settings.json`
        documentation](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/blob/1.8.17/settings.json.template#L446-L447).
      * `canCreate` (optional): See [Etherpad's `settings.json`
        documentation](https://github.com/ether/etherpad-lite/blob/1.8.17/settings.json.template#L448-L449).

#### Default guest user settings

If `settings.json` (or another plugin) does not define a user object for the
guest user, an object like the following is used:

```json
{
  "displayname": "Read-Only Guest",
  "displaynameChangeable": false,
  "readOnly": true
}
```
